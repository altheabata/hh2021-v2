## Unificial - the unofficial official place for cross-university events
#### *A social networking website dedicated to connecting intercollegiate/collegiate organizations and conducting club meetings as seamlessly as possible*
#### *First developed during the Hack(H)er 2021 Hackathon by Althea Bata, Isabel Ojeda, and Astride Toh*

### Inspiration and Problem
We were inspired by our own struggles with attending college club events in the "new normal." When chapters/national organizations advertise events, they tend to be hard to reach, hard to remember, or even hackable. Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours so events can be forgotten, and links can’t be clicked on stories. Links are open to anyone on social media, which provides a security risk. Organizations have to ask “DM us for the link,” when barely anyone wants to DM. Lastly, events announced in emails or newsletters get lost in the inbox or aren’t read through by students.

There needs to be a better platform for attending university events so students to reduce the confusion, difficulty, and likelihood of missing an event.

### Purpose
Unificial is a social networking website dedicated to connecting intercollegiate/collegiate organizations and conducting club meetings as seamlessly as possible. Student organizations can make more impact by increasing attendance to their events, collaborate across colleges, and have one platform to announce all events.

### Challenges
Time and implementation. 

With many assignments from the start of college, we had to meet later in the day via Zoom at night and discuss our plans, ideas, and tasks. This limited the time we had to work on to a few hours in a couple of days, which prevented us from implementing all the features we wanted. For example, our developers faced bugs with connecting through a flask framework. Two versions of a GitHub repo and repl.it later, we had to shift focus to mainly prioritize the features we wanted to showcase on the website.

### Future
We would like to expand on this project in the future by implementing the functionality we intended to develop, such as user login authentication that only accepts .edu emails that can access gated pages such as the feed and profile pages, a google form and calendar that organizations can submit their events to which would go through our MongoDB database and automatically create event cards, and the ability for users to get recommended events, follow organizations, and receive customized push notifications for events they selected to attend. In the future for more privacy, we could also partner with universities to have their school-specific login systems work with the platform. We’ve experienced the struggle of wanting to go to many events to connect with people of likedminded interests, especially now, and know that the systems and platforms out there can be confusing to navigate. 

Unificial is still a work in progress, but we know it has potential and will develop it further!
